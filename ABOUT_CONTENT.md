## House Rules Section

**Title:** House Rules

**Rules (Array):**
1. Dyke night is NOT a sex party. Come through to cruise some hotties and take one (or two, or three) home, and respect the space we have have been lent.
2. CONSENT IS MANDATORY! No one should be touching you without express permission. No exceptions.
3. Understand that Dyke Night will be host to both new and seasoned kinksters. Be mindful of this fact as you cruise, and respect one another's boundaries.
4. Various Dykes will be wearing bright armbands. These are your monitors. If someone giving you trouble, find one of them and they will help you.

## What is Cruising? Section

**Title:** What is Cruising?

**Content (Rich Text):**
```
Cruising is making an intentional conneciton with a stranger. It doesn't always have to be for sex, but the majority of the time it is. It is so electric to make that connection with someone new, face to face.

At Dyke Night we intentionally create a space that encourages cruising. Yes it can get you laid, but more importantly, it fosters a kind of community you can't find online.

## What is Flagging? Section

**Title:** What is Flagging?

**Content (Rich Text):**
```
Modern flagging started in the 1970s as a way for gay men to cruise discreetly. Dykes have adapted the hanky code over time to suit our needs. Flagging takes out a lot of the guesswork and lets you find those with complimentary interests to your own.

We will have an assortment of flags for sale for $1 each.

Broadly speaking:
- Left = Top
- Right = Bottom
- Middle = Switch
```
